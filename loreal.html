            <p>Have you ever had the experience that you wished you’d never come to this hair salon? Have you had the
              feeling that this new hair look ruined your life? Have you been annoyed because the color you just dyed
              has gone away so quickly? Have you yelled at the moment you left the salon? I have the experience myself
              several times, and this project (Loreal Brandstorm 2018) gives me a chance to make deep exploration. The
              goal for the project is to improve customers’ salon experience in order to build a long-term relationship
              with the customers and to further increase the brand loyalty. We have come up with an one-stop system to
              simulate the hairdressing outcome and later store the information in an assisting app.</p>

              <h6 class="loreal-color2"><b>Research</b></h6>
              <p>In 2017, there were 78.17 million people in the US got a haircut 2 to 3 times, and 60.15 million more than 4 times.
                The statistics also predicts that the hair salon industry will keep growing in 5 years, for both men and women. It is
                a booming industry that is worth researched yet still needs to be improved.  To build a strong customer loyalty, customer
                satisfaction of service quality is the most important. Based on both online research and the first data we collected from
                46 surveys and 7 interviews (aged 19 to 47), we have found 3 main pain points which keep the customers from being satisfied
                or even result in a very unpleasant salon experience.</p>
                <h6 class="loreal-color2"><b>Pain Point</b></h6>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Final look is different from the customer’s  expectation.
                    <ul>
                      <li>The style is not suitable for the client.</li>
                      <li>The final color is unlike the one from the hair color mix book.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Hair color goes away very quickly and the faded color is really ugly.</li>
                  <li>It’s hard to maintain the same look that many people feel the look has totally changed the next day.</li>
                </ol>
                <h6 class="loreal-color2"><b>Sample Interview Questions:</b></h6>

              <ul>
                <li>App that helps access previous experience, keep the essential components, and enhance with personal touch.</li>
                <li>User wants to see an evolution of hairstyles. </li>
                <li>Designers need to understand beauty standards of client. (app with database that can help with personalization) </li>
                <li>Interaction and personalization is key. (clients like good conversations and relaxing experience) (app that can record drink preferences and background information to help start conversations)</li>
                <li>Designers give reliable recommendation of  your hair style (consultant) (customers can see the data and the simulated outcomes)</li>
              </ul>
	      <h6 class="loreal-color2"><b>How EYCS System Works</b></h6>
              <p>These problems are resulted from personal difference in hair conditions and living habits. Thus, we wish
                to create a product that can simulate how a hair style will change over time, taking into account personal
                habits and environmental factors. We conducted a good amount of research about current offerings in the
                market and realized that there are a great amount of new technologies that can be combined to create a new
                generation hair salon experience. We will be utilizing technologies such as the detecting brush and AR to
                build a one-stop salon system. The system includes 3 main steps.</p>
              <br>
              <h5 class="loreal-color2"><b>Step 1</b></h5>
              <div class="grid-2">
                <img class="step-pic" src="img/step-p1.png" alt="" style="max-width: 50%;">
                <img class="step-pic" src="img/step-p2.png" alt="" style="max-width: 50%;">
              </div>
              <p>The first step of this process is to collect client information to make accurate simulations. We will be
                 collecting information from four major categories: hair routine, daily routine, environmental factors, hair
                 characteristics. We will collect data by two means: in-app questionnaires and detecting hair brush, which
                 send personalized information to an algorithm to compare with big data and the data will be reflected on the
                 smart mirror.</p>
              <br>
              <div class="step-layout">
                <img src="img/step-layout.png" alt="" style="max-width: 65%;">
              </div>
              <br>
              <h5 class="loreal-color2"><b>Step 2</b></h5>
              <div class="step2">
                <img src="img/step-p3.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%;">
                <p>Our core innovation revolves around leveraging the smart mirror to allow clients to interact with selectors to visualize different hairstyles and hair colors based on his/her personal hair condition.
	                 Algorithms will combine all these input to understand the client’s hair status, how the hair will change with time with or without products, and simulate what the hair will look like in the future.
	                 The smart mirror will uniquely simulate and adjust to different customized external and environmental settings that will impact the quality of their hairstyle or color over time such as time, location,
                   light, and recommended color matches. Clients can interact with various selectors on the smart mirror to visually experience the progression of their hair treatment over the course of time which will help
                   them make the most informed decision about what style and color they should receive.</p>
              </div>
              <br>
              <h5 class="loreal-color2"><b>Step 3</b></h5>
              <div class="step3">
                <p>In-home assistant app will collecting data by asking users some questions (through message box), such as ‘have you washed your hair today' or ‘have you applied hair conditioner today’ on a daily basis. 
			Users can manage the amount and the frequency of the message box questions. Based on the data and users’ activity history, the in-home assistant will recommend the most suitable hair-care methods and products to the users. 
			You can also store your favorite hair looks and schedule salon time on the app. Overall, the best feature of the in-home assistant is that it serves as your hair condition monitor. 
			Thus, not only helping users find the best hair look on them, EYCS System also teaches users how to take care of their hair.</p>

              <p>This was my very first product design project. It also opened the door to uiux design for me. Because of this project, I learn how to see a problem from a user’s perspective. Before this project, 
		      when I did the design work, sometime, I tended to make the designs look fancier yet more complicated. However, doing this project has taught me that “user-friendly” and “intuition-oriented ”  
		      are super important in uiux design. A new understanding of “user-friendly design” is the biggest takeaway for me in this project.</p>
